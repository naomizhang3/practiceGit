## Calendar App
### How to Run
1) Open CalendarProgram file and before running, create two run configurations.
2) One configuration should take the arguments --mode interactive for an interactive experience
   and another configuration should take in --mode headless res/yourFileHere.txt to run an
   entire text file containing commands which should be in the res folder.
3) After typing in CalendarProgram as the main class,
   press run. Type in your desired commands for interactive mode or simply watch your text file
   execute.
### What Works and What Doesn't
* This app supports creating a single event, event series, editing an event, events, or a series,
  printing an event on a given day or date-time range, and showing the user's status on a given
  date-time.
* The app allows for the optional properties, such as description, location and status to be
  inputted in the same manner as the other required properties.
* Creating/editing events with multiple word subjects or descriptions is
  also supported.

### Distribution of Work
* We worked on the project in person every day while pair programming. We both contributed equally
  to thinking about how to design our Calendar and used github for a good workflow and version
  control.
* We only split up some work for documentation and tests. Naomi wrote the documentation for the
  model, and Bear wrote the documentation for the controller and view. We both contributed to
  writing tests for the model, Naomi wrote tests for the controller, and Bear wrote the tests
  for the view.
